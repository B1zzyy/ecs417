        <h1>Lab 3 // Exercise 3</h1>
    </header>

    <p1>I love visiting my home town Blagoevgrad during summer<br></p1> 
    <p1>it brings about childhood memories and thus moments of joy<br></p1>
    <br>
    <p1>Furthermore, I also love visitng the countryside where my <br></p1>
    <p1>grandmother and my other cousins live. The town is very quiet,<br></p1>
    <p1>peaceful and overflowing with wide open smiles on people's faces<br></p1>
    <br>
    <p1>My grandmother has a dog names "Dacho" and a cat named "Jadi"<br></p1>
    <p1>They are always excited to meet new people and thus always<br></p1>
    <p1>hyperactive when they see me or any of my friends in the countryside</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p2>Every time I visit my cousins in the countryside we end up<br></p2> 
    <p2>going to a town nearby filled with hot springs where we would<br></p2>
    <p2>spend the night relaxing.<br></p2>
    <br>
    <p2>After which we would all gather at my town center which is filled<br></p2>
    <p2>with restourants and bars. We tend to sit at a restourant<br></p2>
    <p2>after which we gather at my aunt's house and play board games for the rest of the night.<br></p2>
    <br>
    <p2>My town has a villa in the mountains which me and friends usually rent<br></p2>
    <p2>to celebrate someone's birthday and have a fun time, while<br></p2>
    <p2>listening to music and eating. The villa is found right next to a park<br></p2>
    <p2>which has a lot of deers, peacocks, squirrels and swans.</p2>
